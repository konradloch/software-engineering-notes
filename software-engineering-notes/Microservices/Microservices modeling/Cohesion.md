### Cohesion
"The code that changes together, stays together". We want to find boundaries within our problem domain that help ensure related behavior is in one place and that communicate with other boundaries as loosely as possible. If the related functionality is spread across the system, we say that cohesion is weak—whereas for our microservice architectures we’re aiming for strong cohesion.
