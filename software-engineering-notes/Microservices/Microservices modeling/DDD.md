### Domain-Driven Design
Event Storming (EventStorming by Alberto Brandolini), Aggregation, Bounded Context, Ubiquitous Language

The ideas presented in Eric Evans’s Domain-Driven Design are very useful to us in finding sensible boundaries for our services, and I’ve just scratched the surface here—Eric’s book goes into much more detail. If you want to go deeper, I can recommend Vaughn Vernon’s book Implementing Domain-Driven Design17 to help you understand the practicalities of this approach, while Vernon’s Domain-Driven Design Distilled18 is a great condensed overview if you’re looking for something more brief.
