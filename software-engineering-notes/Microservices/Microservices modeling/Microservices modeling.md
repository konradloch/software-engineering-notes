### Cohesion and Coupling
"A structure is stable if cohesion is strong and coupling is low."

Cohesion applies to the relationship between things inside a boundary (a microservice in our context), whereas coupling describes the relationship between things across a boundary. There is no absolute best way to organize our code; coupling and cohesion are just one way to articulate the various trade-offs we make around where we group code, and why.
