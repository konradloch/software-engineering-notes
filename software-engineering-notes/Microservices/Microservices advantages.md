### Microservices architecture advantages
Advantages of microservices architecure is connecting with distributed system advantages. 

#### Technology Heterogeneity

Every service in microservice architecture might be tailored for given requirements by using specific programming language, framework, database or way it communicate with other services.

#### Robustness
Microservice architecture when is well designed and implemented then has a robustness characteristic. It is about boundaries between services and failures which can occur at service, network or machine level. Well designed system after failure at a given part of the system will only disable this failed part of the system but not the whole system.

#### Scaling
Services in microservice architecture might be scaled horizontally or vertically. The biggest benefit of it is related to scaling part of the system but not the whole system which reduces cost for machine instances. Scaling is useful when services are highly loaded by high request numbers or time consuming work.

#### Ease of Deployment
Every service in microservice architecture might be deployed, updated, removed indepently.  it gives the possibility to offer quick fixes,  high availability of the system and  continuous deployment. System donot have to reload itself as a whole like in monolithic architecture.

#### Organization alignment
Work is better split between multiple teams.

#### Composability
Every single service might be used for different purposes. Microservice architecture is very easy to change at design and implementation level.
